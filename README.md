# 🧭 Synchronized — Shared Workflows, Templates & Security

This repository centralizes the **shared workflows**, **templates**, and **security references** used across all repositories within **Synchronized-TV**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Standardize Pull Requests, Issues, and CI/CD workflows  
- Integrate essential GitHub security controls into the development process  
- Simplify onboarding, maintenance, and release automation

## 🧩 Contents

| Type | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Workflows** | Reusable CI/CD pipelines |
| **Templates** | Pull Request, Issue, and Security Incident templates |
| **Security Policy** | Guidelines for reporting and managing vulnerabilities |
| **Contributing Guide** | Organization-wide contribution rules and conventions |

---

## ⚙️ Reusable Workflows

For **security and reproducibility**, always reference reusable workflows using a **commit SHA**, not a branch (`@main`) or tag (`@v1`).

### 🔁 `bump-version-pr.yml`
Creates a Pull Request that bumps the version (`patch`, `minor`, or `major`) without publishing.

### 🚀 `npm-release.yml`
On merge to `main`, tags the release and publishes the package to npm.

#### Example usage
To use a workflow from this repository in another project, visit the dedicated `release-template` repository.

## 🧭 Contributing

Organization-wide contribution guidelines are defined in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

All repositories follow the same rules for:
- **Branch naming** (`feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `release/`, etc.)
- **Commit conventions** (using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/))
- **Pull request reviews** and **security policies**

> 💡 See the contributing guide for naming rules, PR best practices, and security standards.

## 🛡️ Automated Security (Organization Level)

The following protections apply to all repositories within **Synchronized-TV**:

- **Branch protection rules** on `main` (and optionally `release/*`)  
- **CodeQL** static analysis on Pull Requests  
- **Dependabot** for dependency monitoring  
- **Secret Scanning & Push Protection** to prevent credential leaks  
- **Dependency Review** visible in PRs before merge
