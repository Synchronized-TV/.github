## ⚙️ Reusable Workflows

### 🔁 `bump-version-pr.yml`
Creates a Pull Request that bumps the version (`patch`, `minor`, or `major`) without publishing.

### 🚀 `npm-release.yml`
On merge to `main`, tags the release and publishes the package to npm.

#### Example usage
To use a workflow from this repository in another project:

```yaml
name: release
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      bump:
        description: "Version type"
        type: choice
        options: [patch, minor, major]
        default: patch

jobs:
  release:
    uses: Synchronized-TV/.github/.github/workflows/bump-version-pr.yml@main
    with:
      bump: ${{ inputs.bump }}
      node: "20"
    secrets: inherit
```

## 🧭 Contributing

Organization-wide contribution guidelines are defined in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

All repositories follow the same rules for:
- **Branch naming** (`feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `release/`, etc.)
- **Commit conventions** (using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/))
- **Pull request reviews** and **security policies**

> 💡 See the contributing guide for naming rules, PR best practices, and security standards.

---

## 🛡️ Automated Security (Organization Level)

The following protections apply to all repositories within **Synchronized-TV**:

- **Branch protection rules** on `main` (and optionally `release/*`)  
- **CodeQL** static analysis on Pull Requests  
- **Dependabot** for dependency monitoring  
- **Secret Scanning & Push Protection** to prevent credential leaks  
- **Dependency Review** visible in PRs before merge  

> 🔒 For sensitive operational procedures (e.g., token rotation, internal audit logs), refer to the **private** repository [Synchronized-TV/.internal](https://github.com/Synchronized-TV/.internal).
